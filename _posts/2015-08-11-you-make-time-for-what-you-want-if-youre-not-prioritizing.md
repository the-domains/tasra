description: "\"You make time for what you want. If you're not prioritizing the things you care about, consider the possibility that you don't actually care about those things.\" I started reading The Crossroads of Should and Must by Elle Luna. Halfway through she talks about time. She was at a party where everyone wrote down their wildest craziest dreams on notecards and shared them. So last night at the roastery in downtown Seattle my husband and I did the same. We took a Starbucks map and used it to make our notecards. Then spent the better part of an hour thinking. Dreaming. And writing down our most audacious, terrifying dreams. Then we set down our pens and began to share one at a time each of those dreams that we rarely admit even to ourselves. It was one of the most enlightening and connecting experiences we've shared. Now we're both ready to make them happen. Try it. What's the wildest and most audacious dream living in your heart. I'd love to hear it!!"
