description: " As I work with images combining portraits with nature or buildings, I am struck by a sense that our lives are one long double exposure. We are walking dichotomies saying one thing and doing another. Thinking one thing but saying something different. There's a disharmony to that type of existence. A life disconnected and separate. Perhaps we should be more focused on cultivating that single exposure life that gives us peace inside and out. Perhaps."
